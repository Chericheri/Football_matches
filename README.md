# Football_matches PREVIEW:

In this project, I scrape and predict the winner of football matches in the English Premier League (EPL) from 2023 to 2025.

# Project Steps

1. Scrape match data from 2023 t0 2025 using requests, BeautifulSoup, StringIO, time and pandas.
2. Clean the data and get it ready for machine learning using pandas.
3. Make predictions about who will win a match using scikit-learn.
4. Measure error and improve our predictions.
